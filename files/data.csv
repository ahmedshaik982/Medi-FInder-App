90632,"Vaccine for Hepatitis A injection into muscle, adult dosage",Havrix*,Hepatitis A Virus Vaccine/PF*,"This vaccine is used to help prevent infection from the hepatitis A virus. Hepatitis A infection can be mild with no symptoms or a severe illness that can rarely cause liver failure and death. Preventing infection can prevent these problems. Hepatitis A vaccine is made from whole, killed hepatitis A virus. It does not contain live virus, so you cannot get hepatitis from the vaccine. This vaccine works by helping the body produce immunity (through antibody production) that will prevent you from getting infection from hepatitis A virus. Hepatitis A vaccine does not protect you from other virus infections (such as HIV virus, which causes AIDS; hepatitis B, hepatitis C or hepatitis E; HPV virus, which causes genital warts and other problems). The vaccine is recommended for people aged 12 months and older, especially those at an increased risk of getting the infection. Those at an increased risk include people who live with or spend much time with people with hepatitis A infections, institutional or daycare workers, lab workers, people with multiple sex partners, men who have sex with men, sex workers, injecting and non-injecting drug abusers, and people traveling to high-risk areas."

Too much parathyroid hormone can cause serious problems such as bone disorders. Most people get enough vitamin D from exposure to the sun and from fortified food products (e.g., dairy products, vitamins). Before regular vitamin D can be used by the body, it needs to be changed to the active form by the liver and kidneys. People with kidney disease cannot make enough of the active form of vitamin D. Vitamin D helps control parathyroid hormone and the levels of certain minerals (e.g., calcium, phosphorus) that are needed for building and keeping strong bones."
